The solution involves ensuring the custom UI component doesn't interfere with the Camera component's rendering process. This can be achieved by optimizing component hierarchy or using techniques like `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In some cases, adjusting the `cameraType` prop in the Camera component might also resolve the issue.  Additionally, verifying that all necessary permissions are granted for the app is crucial. 

Below is an example of incorporating `React.memo` to optimize the rendering: 

```javascript
import React, {memo} from 'react';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

const MyCamera = memo(({cameraRef, ...props}) => {
  return (
    <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} ref={cameraRef} {...props}/>
  );
});
```
